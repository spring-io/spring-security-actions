# close-milestones

Closes the milestone of each release of a code freeze (`7.0.5`, `7.1.0-RC1`, `6.5.11`), once the freeze has pushed its branches, and deletes the milestone of a **hotfix that has no issues**. It does the same for the **trackers** that the plan has: the commercial milestones that track the fixes of an active branch (the hotfix, and the next release), which are deleted if they have no issues too. The releases, the trackers and their milestones are in the plan that `plan-freeze` wrote: the OSS repository has the milestones of the OSS and frozen releases, and the commercial repository has those of a hotfix, of a tracker and of long-term support.

## What it does

Each milestone is **read again** first, as issues may have been moved since the plan, and what it reads decides:

| The milestone | What is done | Result |
|---|---|---|
| a hotfix, or a tracker, with no issues at all, open or closed (it may be closed already) | deleted | `deleted` |
| closed already | left alone | `already-closed` |
| open, no open issues | closed | `closed` |
| open, with open issues | closed all the same, the summary says how many | `closed-with-open` |
| any of the above, and GitHub refused | the others go on | `failed` |

Only the milestone of a hotfix or of a tracker is ever deleted, and a deletion cannot be undone. If any milestone failed, the action fails at the end and names each one: the freeze is done by then, so the milestone is closed by hand.

A dry run does not run this action: the summary says what it would do from the plan.

## Inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `plan-file` | `code-freeze/plan.json` in `RUNNER_TEMP` | The plan, which has the milestone of each release. |
| `milestones-file` | `code-freeze/milestones.json` in `RUNNER_TEMP` | Where to write the result of each milestone. |
| `token` | required | A token that writes the milestones of both repositories. |

## Outputs

`milestones-file`: for each milestone, `version`, `repository`, `number`, `url`, the `open` and `closed` issues that it was read with, and `result` (`error` if it failed).

## Secrets and permissions

The token needs **Issues: Read and write** on the OSS and on the commercial repository (fine-grained), or `repo` (classic).

## Trying it

`npm ci`, then `npm test`: no network and no token.
