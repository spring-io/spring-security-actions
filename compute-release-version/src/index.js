 *   availability of the train, which the workflow sets. Only commercial versions name a train.
 * - active: a hotfix (7.0.1.1) is released from the commercial repository, and is in the train
 *   of the OSS version it fixes (7.0.1): the milestone of that version in the OSS repository
 *   gives the train, with its due date. The milestone of the hotfix needs to exist, and any due
